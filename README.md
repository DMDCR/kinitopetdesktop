# DMD's Unofficial KinitoPET Desktop Assistant!
This project will update periodically, and I plan on keeping it active for a while!

* Please read the [Issues](#issues) and [Compatibility](#compatibility-list) tables for more info!

# Planned updates!
* Dialog Bubble!
* Making Kinito Draggable *(I am unsure if this is important, as Kinito does move around quickly enough for it to not be an issue.)*
