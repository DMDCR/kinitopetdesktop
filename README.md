# DMD's Unofficial KinitoPET Desktop Assistant!
This project will update periodically, and I plan on keeping it active for a while!

### ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS 10/11! 
*(unless you run the source code using older python versions, which I cannot guarantee compatibility!)*

## Known Issues in the latest Pre-release/Beta version
* ~~Kinito not talking, at all. *(unsure why.)*~~ | Should be fixed! ✔️


# Planned updates!
* Box showing what Kinito is saying!
* Making Kinito Draggable *(I am unsure if this is important, as Kinito does move around quickly enough for it to not be an issue.)*
